        "From reading Chapter 1 of *Think Python*, I gained an understanding of terminology not just associated with Python, but with Computer Programming in general. Some of these terms include the definition of program as \"a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation\" as well as a description that every programming language includes inputs and outputs, mathematical operations, conditional executions, as well as repeition. Section 2 explained how interpreters are necessary to read Python as well as prompt displays from Python interpreters. Secions 3-5 include details to the basic functions of python, including print statements, math operations, as well as type classifications. Section 6 outlined the differences between natural languages, such as English, and formal languages, such as Python. Section 7 explained out programming errors are called \"bugs\" and that the process of tracking them down is called \"debugging\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Toal's Notes on Computing and Computer Science were very helpful in providing clear distinctions between the terminology that I did not previously understand. Most importantly, \"Computation is a principle, not a tool,\" and \"computing is a natural science of information processes.\" This definition not only clarified my previous idea of computation, but also excited me about the scientific applications of computation. From his notes on Computer Science, I most appreciated his definition that \"Computer Science is the theory and practice of computation, algorithms, software systems, data organization, knowledge representation, language, intelligence, learning, and consciousness,\" and I am excited to dive deeper into studying computer science. \n",
